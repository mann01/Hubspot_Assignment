Debrief on potential improvements and issues
encountered:
Code Quality and Readability:
The code would benefit from better modularization by extracting the data
processing logic into separate service layers (e.g.,
HubSpotService , ActionService ). Error handling could be more consistent and centralized
using a custom error handler class. The configuration (API endpoints, property
names, batch sizes) should be moved to a separate config file rather than being
hardcoded. Adding TypeScript would improve type safety and make the code
more maintainable.
Project Architecture:
The current architecture mixes concerns - data fetching, processing, and storage
are tightly coupled. We should implement a proper service layer pattern with clear
separation of concerns. A queue system like Redis or RabbitMQ would be better
for handling actions instead of in-memory arrays. Configuration management
should be improved using a proper config service with environment-specific
settings. Adding integration tests and monitoring would make the system more
robust.
Code Performance:
Several performance improvements could be made: implementing caching for
frequently accessed data (like contact emails), using batch processing for actions
instead of individual pushes, and optimizing the pagination logic to reduce API
calls. The contact email fetching could be optimized by batching requests instead
of making individual API calls. We could also implement parallel processing for
different HubSpot objects (contacts, companies, meetings) when handling
multiple accounts.
Bugs/Issues Encountered:
During implementation, we faced issues with malformed OAuth tokens (truncated
with "...") in the database, incorrect filter operators (GTQ/LTQ instead of GTE/LTE),
and potential memory issues with large action arrays. The error handling for API
rate limits could be improved, and there's a risk of data loss if the process crashes
before saving the last pulled dates.
